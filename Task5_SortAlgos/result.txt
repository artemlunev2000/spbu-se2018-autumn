Sorting algorithms were tested on special file of randomized strings where each string has length between 1 and 15.

As we can see Bubble and Insertion are the worst when the input file has more than 10K elements to sort.
Anyway they can be slighty better with small input because of simple realisation.
Between 1K and 10K Radix seems to be a good alternative to the fastest algorithms - Quick and Merge, but with 
increasing the number of strings his time is becoming worse and worse rapidly.
In the all tests Merge has pretty the same execution time as Quick, but in last one we can see Quick is twice faster than Merge.
So we can conclude that the current realisation of Quick Sort is the best in comparison with others listed above.
